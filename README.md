# TL;DR;

```bash
$ docker run --name nginx bitnami/nginx:latest
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-nginx/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# How to deploy NGINX Open Source in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami NGINX Open Source Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/nginx).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

> NOTE: Debian 8 images have been deprecated in favor of Debian 9 images. Bitnami will not longer publish new Docker images based on Debian 8.
> NOTE: RHEL images are not available in any public registry. You can build them on your side on top of RHEL as described on this [doc](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/getting_started_with_containers/index#creating_docker_images).

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami NGINX Open Source Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/nginx).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/nginx:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the
[list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/nginx/tags/)
in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/nginx:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/nginx:latest https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-nginx.git
```

# Hosting a static website

This NGINX Open Source image exposes a volume at `/app`. Content mounted here is served by the default catch-all virtual host.

```bash
$ docker run -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/nginx:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    image: 'bitnami/nginx:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/app:/app
```

# Accessing your server from the host

To access your web server from your host machine you can ask Docker to map a random port on your host to ports `8080` and `8443` exposed in the container.

```bash
$ docker run --name nginx -P bitnami/nginx:latest
```

Run `docker port` to determine the random ports Docker assigned.

```bash
$ docker port nginx
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769
```

You can also manually specify the ports you want forwarded from your host to the container.

```bash
$ docker run -p 9000:8080 bitnami/nginx:latest
```

Access your web server in the browser by navigating to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).

# Configuration

## Adding custom virtual hosts

The default `nginx.conf` includes virtual hosts placed in `/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/`. You can mount a `my_vhost.conf` file containing your custom virtual hosts at this location.

For example, in order add a vhost for `www.example.com`:

# Step 1: Write your `my_vhost.conf` file with the following content.

```nginx
server {
  listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
  server_name www.example.com;
  root /app;
  index index.htm index.html;
}
```

# Step 2: Mount the configuration as a volume.

```bash
$ docker run --name nginx \
  -v /path/to/my_vhost.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/my_vhost.conf:ro \
  bitnami/nginx:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    image: 'bitnami/nginx:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/my_vhost.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/my_vhost.conf:ro
```

## Using custom SSL certificates

*NOTE:* The steps below assume that you are using a custom domain name and that you have already configured the custom domain name to point to your server.

### Step 1: Prepare your certificate files

In your local computer, create a folder called `certs` and put your certificates files. Make sure you rename both files to `server.crt` and `server.key` respectively:

```bash
$ mkdir -p /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs
$ cp /path/to/certfile.crt /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs/server.crt
$ cp /path/to/keyfile.key  /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs/server.key
```

### Step 2: Provide a custom Virtual Host for SSL connections

Write your `my_vhost.conf` file with the SSL configuration and the relative path to the certificates:

```nginx
  server {
    listen       8443 ssl;

    ssl_certificate      bitnami/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key  bitnami/certs/server.key;

    ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  5m;

    ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

    location / {
      root   html;
      index  index.html index.htm;
    }
  }
```

### Step 3: Run the NGINX Open Source image and open the SSL port

Run the NGINX Open Source image, mounting the certificates directory from your host.

```bash
$ docker run --name nginx \
  -v /path/to/my_vhost.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/my_vhost.conf:ro \
  -v /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs:/certs \
  bitnami/nginx:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    image: 'bitnami/nginx:latest'
    ports:
    - '80:8080'
    - '443:8443'
    volumes:
    - /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs:/certs
    - /path/to/my_vhost.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/my_vhost.conf:ro
```

## Full configuration

The image looks for configurations in `/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`. You can overwrite the `nginx.conf` file using your own custom configuration file.


```bash
$ docker run --name nginx \
  -v /path/to/your_nginx.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:ro \
  bitnami/nginx:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    image: 'bitnami/nginx:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your_nginx.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:ro
```

# Reverse proxy to other containers

NGINX can be used to reverse proxy to other containers using Docker's linking system. This is particularly useful if you want to serve dynamic content through an NGINX frontend. To do so, [add a virtual host](#adding-custom-virtual-hosts) like the following in the `/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/` folder:

```
server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
    server_name yourapp.com;
    access_log /opt/bitnami/nginx/logs/yourapp_access.log;
    error_log /opt/bitnami/nginx/logs/yourapp_error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        proxy_pass http://[your_container_alias]:[your_container_port];
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

# Logging

The Bitnami NGINX Open Source Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```bash
$ docker logs nginx
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose logs nginx
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Customizing this image

Refer to the [customize instructions](./custom/README.md) for more information on how to extend this image.
